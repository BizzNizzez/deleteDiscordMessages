# messageId

You can delete messages after as specific message, before a specific message, or everything between two points. For that you need to provide a messageID:


- Right click a message, [Copy ID](./developerMode.md)

If you don't specify any messageID, it will try to delete every message in that channel.

> If the `Copy ID` doesn't show up, you need to enable [Developer mode](./developerMode.md) first.
