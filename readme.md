    ```js
    // fill with your info
    var authToken = "MTX5MzQ1MjAyMjU0NjA2MzM2.ROFLMAO.UvqZqBMXLpDuOY3Z456J3JRIfbk";
    var authorId = "112233445566778899";
    var channelId = "112233445566778899";
    var firstMessageId = "";

    deleteMessages(authToken, authorId, channelId, firstMessageId); //start

# DO NOT SHARE YOUR `authToken`!

Sharing your authToken on the internet will give full access to your account! [There are bots gathering credentials all over the internet](https://github.com/rndinfosecguy/Scavenger).
If you post your token by accident, LOGOUT from discord on that **same browser** you got that token imediately.
Changing your password will make sure that you get logged out of every device. I advice that you turn on [2FA](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/219576828-Setting-up-Two-Factor-Authentication) afterwards.

If you are unsure do not share screenshots, or copy paste logs on the internet.
